<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000">GENI - a Small Expert System<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>There are many areas related to the topic of Artificial Intelligence. Natural
language processing (NLP), robotics and object recognition are just a few. The
AI domain also includes Expert Systems, an area which is getting more and more
attention. In fact, Expert Systems and expert system shells are quickly becoming
the most researched topic of AI because many corporations are finding that
expert systems can help to make quick and important business decisions.</p>
<p>GENI.PRO is a small classification-type expert system. GENI shows how to
construct a small expert system that figures out which of seven animals (if any)
the system's user has in mind. The expert system will figure out the animal by
asking questions then making deductions from the replies given.</p>
<p>To run GENI, simply load GENI.prj into Visual Prologs editor and select RUN.
After compiling, the program will display the opening menu. The consultation
with the knowledge base, GENI.DBA will begin.</p>
<p>GENI will begin to prompt you with questions concerning the domain given.
Since GENI is a classification expert system, it will try to identify an object.
When you use the knowledge base supplied (GENI.DBA), the domains are based on
animals, so you will need to have an animal in mind when you answer GENI's
prompts.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that you have chosen &quot;bird&quot; as the domain. In
other words, you are trying to classify a bird . GENI begins the consultation by
prompting with</p>
<p><em>Is it true that it has feathers:</em></p>
<p>Assume that you are trying to identify a penguin. Since all birds have
feathers, you use the answer menu to answer &quot;Yes&quot; to this prompt.
Simply press Enter to select Yes; GENI will come back with the prompt</p>
<p><em>Is it true that it has long legs:</em></p>
<p>The bird does not have long legs. Answer the question.</p>
<p>From here, GENI will continue to prompt you, searching for a solution to the
animal you have in mind.</p>
<p><em>Is it true that it swims:</em></p>
<p>Since you are trying to solve for the penguin, you must answer Yes to the
prompt asking if the bird swims. This brings up the prompt</p>
<p><em>Is it true that it has a black and white color:</em></p>
<p>Penguins are black and white, so again, you must answer &quot;Yes.&quot;
Here, GENI makes a conclusion and reports that it thinks the bird is a penguin.
GENI now asks whether its conclusion is correct. Answer Yes to this query by
typing in a lowercase yes.</p>
<p>A typical user dialogue with this expert system might be:</p>
<blockquote>
  <!--mstheme--></font><pre>has it hair?
yes
does it eat meat?
yes
has it a fawn color?
yes
has it dark spots?
yes

Your animal may be a cheetah!</pre><!--mstheme--><font face="verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
