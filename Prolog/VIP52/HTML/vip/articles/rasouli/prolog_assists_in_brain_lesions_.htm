<p>MRI-WIZ software was developed to determine the technical feasibility of an expert
system for differential diagnosis in neuroradiology. This frame based expert system,
developed in Visual Prolog, stores the Magnetic Resonance (MR) and Computerized Tomography
(CT) imaging characteristics of over 100 known brain disorders in object-like entities.
The frames, organized in a hierarchical relationship, have the highest frames containing
information that applies to all lower frames. A decision tree menu provides a
user-friendly interface that navigates through the network based upon lesion features as
depicted on MR and CT images. Once the appropriate node on the tree menu is chosen, the
user responds to CT and MR related questions - to obtain information about the lesion. The
exact location of the brain lesion, as seen on the MR and CT images, is determined by the
user on the color coded, hot-linked cross sectional diagrams of the brain. Program
execution follows a consultation paradigm using a dynamic database and provides a
differential diagnosis based on MR findings alone. Adding CT-related information may
further refine the diagnosis. The program utilizes extensive on-line hypertext-based help
information about the lesions with actual CT and MR images.</p>

<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000"></font><font size="4">Introduction<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<p></font><font SIZE="2">Expert systems, using knowledge and inference techniques, mimic
human reasoning and decision-making to solve problems. Production and frame-based systems
are two basic types of expert systems1. In the production system, the knowledge is stored
as a large body of facts2, along with rules expressing relationship between these facts.
These programs base their decisions on rules and facts typically represented in the form
of if-then rules. Each rule relates information that is known or could be known about a
particular domain to something that can be inferred from that knowledge. By combining the
applicable rules, the expert system can reach a conclusion or make a diagnosis. The
frame-based system, an efficient and powerful form of data structure, represents
contextual information about objects, concepts, or events. The frames, organized in a
hierarchical structure, allow lower order frames to inherit attributes from higher order
frames, with the highest frame containing information that applies to all other frames.</p>

<p>Expert systems have been assisting clinicians in areas such as infectious disease
therapy for many years. While radiological technology relies heavily on computers, it has
been slow to develop an expert system to aid in diagnosis. In 1992 we developed BONEX, a
menu-driven DOS-based expert system for the radiological diagnosis of bone tumors using
PDC Prolog. BONEX, a rule-based expert system, leads the user through a menu of questions,
generates a hard copy report and a list of diagnosis with an estimate of the likelihood of
each.</p>

<p>The success of BONEX was very well received at the 1992 annual meeting of the
Radiological Society of North America (RSNA)3 which led us to consider the application of
an expert system for the diagnosis of brain lesions. The objective of developing a program
that could be accessed directly from MR imaging or CT console required the development of
a Windows-based program with a programming environment that had previously been
unavailable.</p>

<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000"></font><font size="4">System Methodology and Architecture<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<p></font><font SIZE="2">In neuroradiology, MR imaging is the most prevalent imaging
modality for the diagnosis of cerebral lesions. Useful adjunctive information is often
obtained with CT and when integrated with the patient's age and clinical symptoms, the
radiologist suggests the diagnosis or develops a short list of differential diagnoses4.
The diagnostic process has limitations, however, resulting from human error caused by a
lack of knowledge, a nonsystematic approach, or even forgetfulness5. An attractive
solution to this dilemma is the use of artificial intelligence based technology, such as
an expert system, that draws conclusions based on facts stored in a knowledge base.
However, even the best expert systems have limitations when compared with the human
expert, who is often able to apply intuition and common sense to solve problems when no
formal solutions or analogy exists.</p>

<p>To determine the technical feasibility of an expert system in diagnosing brain lesions,
the MRI-WIZ program was developed. Prolog was selected as the language of choice for
implementing the program. Prolog programs, a collection of facts and rules about a
particular knowledge domain, are unique in their ability to infer facts and conclusions
from other facts. The program is really a database, with Prolog the very powerful query
language. The database characteristics make the language ideal for problems that are
unstructured and for which the procedures to solve it are unknown. Both production and
frame-based expert systems can be built with Prolog. MRI-WIZ uses a frame-based expert
system to store MR and CT imaging characteristics of over 100 known brain disorders4. The
prototype version of the MRI-WIZ for Windows was developed using Visual Prolog based on
its fully visual programming capabilities and cross-platform portability. The other
attractive features of Visual Prolog include tools for making Windows help files and
facilities for creating dynamic web pages. The program was field tested on proven cases at
Ottawa General Hospital (Ontario, Canada) as the prototype program was being refined. The
system was also showcased at the Department of the Future exhibit at the 1995 scientific
assembly and annual meeting of the RSNA6. In this article, steps that were taken to refine
and expand the program after the field testing and showcasing are discussed.</p>

<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000"></font><font size="4">Program Refinement and Expansion<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<p></font><font SIZE="2">Based on discussions with several neuroradiologists during and
after the 1995 exhibit, and the intensive verification and validation of the program on
proven cases at Ottawa General Hospital, a 400-bed teaching hospital at The University of
Ottawa, the program was modified to satisfy the end users' requirements. The modifications
included cosmetic and conceptual changes to the program as well as knowledge enhancement
of the database to improve the systems credibility. The changes include:</p>

<p><em><strong>Location Menu </strong></em>- A graphical method of location identification
was implemented providing a list of possible locations. The diagram (Figure 1), divided
into eight segments, illustrates eight cross sectional views of the brain. The different
regions of the brain are color coded and linked to a special database. When a region is
selected via the mouse, the program displays the name of the region and asks for
confirmation. Main Tree-Menu - A decision tree menu provides a user-friendly interface
that navigates through the response network. Since the program provides a differential
diagnosis based on MR imaging alone and is further refined by CT-related information,
there were originally separate nodes for MR and CT options on each branch. As a result,
the opening tree-menu looked complex and confusing. In the new version, the MR and CT
nodes are combined (Figure 2), and a Not Known option was added to the response boxes
enabling the radiologist to use the program without the CT information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<em><strong>Diagnosis Report</strong></em> - In the new version, in addition to
the list of diagnoses, the user response to various questions is also summarized in an
abbreviated form on top of the diagnosis report (Figure 3). If an abbreviation is in
question, a &quot;glossary&quot; furnishes the user with abbreviations and meanings with
the click of the mouse (Figure 4).</p>

<p>Figure 4: Glossary of the abbreviated terms</p>

<p><em><strong>&nbsp;Online Help</strong></em> - One of the main features of the program
is an extensive online hypertext-based help system containing information on all the
lesions in the knowledge base. Users can refer to the comprehensive help menu for
clarification purposes, or for a &quot;hands-on&quot; approach to identify brain lesions.
The general description of a lesion under the help topic consists of: population at risk,
prognosis, and differential diagnosis. Topics are accompanied by actual MR and CT images
(Figure 5).</p>

<p>&nbsp;<em><strong>Modular Design</strong></em> - MRI-WIZ is modular with different
aspects of the program and knowledge base in separate modules. This proves to be very
helpful during the program modification and expansion process. The approach is also very
useful during the program validation process since it allows for use of different versions
of the knowledge base with minimal effort.</p>

<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000"></font><font size="4">&nbsp;Using MRI-WIZ<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<p></font><font SIZE="2">MRI-WIZ opens with a tree menu displaying various nodes; each
node represents a possible signal intensity of a lesion. Before selecting the signal
intensity the user identifies the location of the lesion by using the mouse on a
color-coded diagram with eight cross sectional views of the brain.</p>

<p>Once the location is identified, the user is presented with a series of possibilities
in the form of a decision tree. Begining with a broad array of options, the program
gradually becomes more specific as each affirmed characteristic leads to a new series of
options.</p>

<p>First, the user must identify whether the signal intensity of the lesion on T1-weighted
images is Dark, Bright, or Isointense (relative to the neighboring normal brain tissue).
If chosen, a fourth option, Other, allows the user to select from: Fluid Level
(bi-intensity), Mixed intensity, Cystic intensity, Signal Void, or Hypointense Rim on T2.
After describing the T1-weighted image, the user is presented with similar options for the
T2-weighted image, Dark or Bright.</p>

<p>Next, several questions appear about the lesion.These questions can be yes-or-no, or
contain options (Figure 6). In the CT related questions, a Not Known alternative is
available to enable the user to pursue diagnosis in the absence of the CT information on
the basis of MR information only. Required information includes data about the contrast
enhancement, calcification, CT density, perilesional edema, hemorrhage, multiplicity,
size, and hydrocephalus or ventriculomegaly. At any point throughout the procedure, the
user may opt to cancel the search. </p>

<p>After completing the survey, the questions and user-provided answers are displayed
together in abbreviated form. Beneath the synopsis of responses, the possible diagnoses
are listed. The program also specifies if the lesion occurs in adult or pediatric
populations, or in both. </p>

<p>Figure 6: Response box with multiple options</p>

<p>&nbsp;In addition to the step-by-step, diagnosis application of the program, users may
utilize MRI-WIZ as a reference. The Help menu not only offers operational support, but
also extends detailed descriptions of all lesions in the knowledge base, classified by
location of the lesion, category of the lesion, and age of the patient. The online help
can also be accessed from the alphabetical list or through a simple search command.</p>

<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000"></font><font size="4">&nbsp;Conclusion<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<p></font><font SIZE="2">The introduction of computers to radiological imaging
revolutionized radiology in the 60's and 70's with the development of Computer Assisted
Tomography (CAT scanning), which later was extended to sonographic imaging, magnetic
resonance imaging and digital subtraction angiography. The role of computers in
radiological imaging, until recently, however, has mainly been confined to processing
complex matrix data of radiological densities to produce gray scale digital images. The
introduction of expert systems promises another major advancement brought to radiology by
computers, this time in the area of diagnosis. Although it will be possible to train
computers to scan images and make diagnosis independently, it is more accurate and,
ultimately, safer to have the radiologist view images and feed the information to the
computer. In this form of application, the radiologist also acts as the final referee in
accepting or rejecting the diagnostic possibilities rendered by the computer. As we have
shown, expert systems can play a vital role in advancing the field of radiological
diagnosis.</p>
