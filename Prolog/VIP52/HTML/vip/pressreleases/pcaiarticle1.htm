<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000">1 Introduction<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<p>Modern day general-purpose programming languages (BASIC, C/C++, Java, Pascal, etc.) are
high-powered tools for software development. Yet today's top programmers often choose
special-purpose, Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), such as HTML or SQL, for large portions
of their applications. Their reasoning is simply that using a language designed
specifically for a particular task appreciably increases programmer productivity and the
reliability of the resulting applications. </p>

<p>But if DSLs offer significant productivity and reliability benefits, why don't
programmers create <i>new</i> DSLs as a natural part of application development? One
reason is that many developers believe that creating programming languages is a
necessarily difficult and time-consuming task, and therefore only makes sense when
considerable reuse is anticipated. Others simply aren't familiar with advanced language
design and implementation techniques. But fortunately, because of their restricted and
focused nature, DSLs are relatively easy to design and implement. </p>

<p>In this paper we look at why DSLs are important and consider some popular (and
not-so-popular) examples of them. We then argue that creating DSLs should be part of basic
software engineering, and describe a framework for implementing declarative DSLs.&nbsp; So
read on and discover how your development strategy can benefit from this exciting
technology! <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000">2 What are DSLs and why should we use them?<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<p>A DSL is a programming language designed to support applications in a narrow subject
area (domain). As such, a DSL contains constructs that <i>directly</i> represent concepts
in the application domain, thereby raising the level of abstraction. And when programmers
work at high levels of abstraction, they are more productive, typically write less code,
and their programs are generally more reliable, verifiable, and maintainable. </p>

<p>To appreciate this point, imagine having to write an assembly language program that
calculates and displays the result of a mathematical expression such as </p>

<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <!--mstheme--></font><pre>14*2.33/4</pre><!--mstheme--><font face="verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<!--msthemelist--></table><!--mstheme--><font face="verdana, Arial, Helvetica">

<p>It would require many lines of code and, upon examination, it would not be immediately
apparent that the program is correct. If instead you used a higher level language, like
BASIC, the program would become simply </p>

<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <!--mstheme--></font><pre>print 14*2.33/4</pre><!--mstheme--><font face="verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<!--msthemelist--></table><!--mstheme--><font face="verdana, Arial, Helvetica">

<p>But now suppose that a requirement of the application domain is that, anytime the
result of an expression is printed, it must also be accompanied by the expression itself,
the time at which the expression was evaluated, and the name of the user running the
program, each separated by a comma. In BASIC this would become </p>

<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <!--mstheme--></font><pre>print 14*2.33/4; &quot;,&quot;; &quot;14*2.33/4,&quot;; TIME$; &quot;,&quot;; USER$</pre><!--mstheme--><font face="verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<!--msthemelist--></table><!--mstheme--><font face="verdana, Arial, Helvetica">

<p>which is certainly an error-prone and verbose way to do it (and assumes that TIME$ and
USER$ are variables which somehow contain the current time and user respectively). If
instead a DSL was crafted for applications of this sort, the statement could once again be
simply </p>

<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <!--mstheme--></font><pre>print 14*2.33/4</pre><!--mstheme--><font face="verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<!--msthemelist--></table><!--mstheme--><font face="verdana, Arial, Helvetica">

<p>but would have the required semantics. Of course this is a contrived example, but one
which hopefully captures your imagination as to the potential power of DSL technology. </p>

<p>There are many commercially available DSLs in use today. Two of the more popular
examples are HTML (document formatting) and SQL (relational databases). </p>

    that it becomes feasible to transmit the program source code from a client machine to the
    server for remote execution. Doing so allows the program to execute on the machine(s)

<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000">3 The Perfect DSL for Every Application<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<p>If you take the previous section&#146;s discussion of abstraction to it&#146;s natural
conclusion, it becomes clear that the best DSL in which to develop a given application is
one specifically designed for that application domain. But what do you do when this <i>ideal</i>
DSL doesn&#146;t already exist (which will typically be the case)? You build it.
That&#146;s right, you design and implement a language perfectly suited for the domain. </p>

<p>Before you dismiss this proposal as outrageous, consider the advantages of this
approach to application development. In addition to the productivity and reliability
benefits we&#146;ve already talked about, your domain-experts (your customers) can examine
application code and verify that it is correct, even if they&#146;re not programmers. In
fact, they can actually write and maintain significant portions of the application code
themselves! </p>

<p>And your customers will save money and time over the long run because of the ease with
which you or they can make changes to their applications. Remember that programs <i>always</i>
have more than one version. Every application undergoes numerous changes throughout its
lifetime, even before the first official version is released. If prior to developing an
application, you first develop a DSL for the application&#146;s domain, changes to the
application will be much easier to make. </p>

<p>We have successfully used this technique a number of times in our consulting practice. </p>

    describe various properties of the application to be overlaid (e.g. the files which
    comprise the application, the functions which contain hidden calls to other functions, and
    those functions which should always be resident in memory). The DSL language processor
    would analyze the application to be overlaid, produce an optimized overlay script, and
    then invoke the overlay linker, resulting in an overlaid executable that was safe and

<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000">4 So what&#146;s the problem? Why isn&#146;t everyone doing it?<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<p>Some developers think it&#146;s generally too costly and time-consuming to develop
languages, and that it only makes sense when considerable re-use is anticipated. Others
are simply unfamiliar with advanced language design and implementation techniques. </p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000">Design<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>Granted, good language design can be challenging. But the same is true of good
application design. For some domains it&#146;s difficult; for others, trivial. Although a
thorough treatment of language design is beyond the scope of this paper, the key idea
behind creating an effective DSL is to identify the <i>variant</i> concepts of the
application domain, and those <i>invariant</i> concepts that require extensive discovery
and experimentation to clarify. You then define language constructs which directly
represent these concepts. Often, these constructs will take the form of parameterizations
of some underlying mechanism, such that the resulting DSL has a declarative flavor (as
opposed to procedural). In our experience, domain experts find declarative languages
considerably easier to use than procedural. </p>

<p>In Section 6 we show an example of designing a simple DSL. </p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000">Implementation<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>Several strategies are effective at simplifying DSL implementation. One is to use a
parser generator and a high-level, high-performance language especially suited for
language implementation (such as Visual Prolog --- see the sidebar at the end of this
paper). Another strategy is to develop a generic DSL framework and then use this framework
for each new DSL. In the next section we present one such framework we&#146;ve recently
developed. <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000">5 A Framework For Implementing Declarative DSLs<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<p>We have developed a DSL framework (DSLX) which simplifies the implementation of
declarative DSLs. To accomplish this, there is the restriction that each DSL have the same
base syntax, one strongly resembling core XML. By making this requirement, all DSLs can
share a common infrastructure such that, for example, a parser need be implemented only
once, and end-user training and documentation is minimized. Additionally, since DSLX
syntax is essentially XML, each new DSL is simple to parse and simple to teach (a
non-programmer could probably learn how to read it within a few minutes). </p>

<p>An application developed with the DSLX framework has four primary components: </p>

<p>To develop an application using the framework, you would generally do the following: </p>

  <li>Study your application domain and define a DSL within the boundaries of DSLX syntax.</li>
  <li>Create a Document Processor for the language.</li>
  <li>Register the DSL and Document Processor with the framework.</li>
  <li>Create the application&#146;s Driver.</li>
  <li>Write a program in the new DSL.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the following section, we illustrate the use of the DSLX framework as we implement a
simple personality testing system. <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000">6 Using the DSLX Framework: Creating a Personality Testing System<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<p>Suppose that your customer wants to develop an application that assesses the degree to
which someone can tolerate stress. The application should ask the user a series of
multiple-choice questions, then score the answers and present the assessment. So three
obvious variant concepts in this domain are <em>questions</em>, <em>answers</em>, and <em>assessments</em>.
And to tie answers to assessments, each answer could have a score associated with it,
where each assessment would be keyed by a range of scores (low to high). This analysis
leads to a simple DSL, where Figure 2 shows a possible document in this language. <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p><img src="pcai1_figure2.gif" alt="pcai1_figure2.gif (29027 bytes)" WIDTH="568" HEIGHT="387"></p>

<p><em><font SIZE="2"><b>Figure 2: Sample DSL Statements of Personality Testing System.
Each question has two parts, the text of the question itself (possibly containing special
formatting information, e.g. &lt;emphasize&gt;) and each possible answer. Each possible
answer has answer text and a score. Each assessment has a low and high range and the text
of the assessment (which also may contain special formatting instructions).</b></font></em></p>

<p>Now let&#146;s briefly look at how the framework might be used to construct this system
(please refer to Figure 1). The Driver would be responsible for the overall user-interface
and flow of the application. So it might be coded to load a file containing DSL
source-text and then pass this text to the Document Manager. The Document Manager would
parse the source-text, create a document (an abstract syntax tree) representing the
source-text, and then return the document id (DocId) of the newly created document to the
Driver. (A of Figure 1) </p>

<p>The Driver could then pass this DocId and a callback function (which responds to
messages from the framework) to the Dispatcher for processing. The Dispatcher, in turn,
would pass the DocId and callback to the appropriate Document Processor; the one we create
for processing documents written in our new DSL. (B and C of Figure 1) </p>

<p>Our language&#146;s Document Processor would be responsible for three functions: 1)
numbering, formatting, and presenting each question to the user, 2) collecting and scoring
the answers, and 3) presenting the assessment to the user. To simplify the Document
Processor&#146;s construction, it could use an embedded HTML viewer for all I/O with the
user. </p>

<p>So to present a question to the user, the Document Processor would first retrieve a
question from the document by interacting with the Document Manager via its API (D of
Figure 1). It would then write HTML code that represents the formatted question and pass
this HTML to the HTML viewer (see Figure 3). <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p><a href="stress0.gif"><img src="../articles/pdc_atlanta/stress0_small.gif" alt="stress0.gif (38331 bytes)" width="100" height="75"></a></p>

<p><em><font SIZE="2"><b>Figure 3: Stress Test Document Processor presents questions to
user. Compare the contents of the center window with the &lt;question&gt; statements in
Figure 2. Note that by having the Document Processor make most formatting decisions, the
DSL can be greatly simplified and the high level of abstraction preserved.</b></font></em></p>

<p>When the user has finished answering all of the questions, the Document Processor would
score the test and then search the document (again via interacting with the Document
Manager) for the assessment that matches the score. The text associated with the
assessment would be retrieved, converted to HTML, and presented to the user via the HTML
viewer (see Figure 4). <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p><a href="stress.gif"><img src="../articles/pdc_atlanta/stress_small.gif" alt="stress.gif (35224 bytes)" width="100" height="75"></a></p>

<p><em><font SIZE="2"><b>Figure 4: Stress Test Document Processor displays assessment to
user. After totaling the user&#146;s score (60 in this case), the Document Processor
searched the possible assessments for the one in the proper range (refer to Figure 2). It
then formatted and displayed the assessment.</b></font></em></p>

<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000">7 Conclusion<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<p>All programmers use programming languages. The best programmers maximize their
productivity as well as the reliability and maintainability of their applications by
choosing the right language for each job. The best language will <i>always</i> be a DSL
specifically designed for the programming task at hand. But unfortunately, the ideal DSL
doesn&#146;t always exist. When it doesn&#146;t, we believe that developers should
consider creating it, right then and there. </p>

<p>You know what your customers want. They want projects completed on time and within
budget. But they also want reliability, maintainability, and extensibility. You can give
them these things by taking a DSL approach to application development. It&#146;s a
different way of thinking about software engineering, but we believe it&#146;s the best
way. Give DSLs a try in your next project, and you may never build an application with
purely conventional languages again! <br>

      <li>Execute the parser generator to produce the actual parser.</li>
      <li>Add the surrounding application code, including that which will &quot;execute&quot; the
