This is a very handy color setup dialog which has the advantage,
that several items can be set up simultaneously without too much
mouse clicking.

The advantage is that it is not possible to pop up the color
dialog for each item that needs to have a color and brush defined.

The dialog displays two fields, one that shows how lines will look
for the given selection, and one field, that shown how filled areas
will look. This is very handy when the screen card displays only 16
or 256 simultaneous colors.
