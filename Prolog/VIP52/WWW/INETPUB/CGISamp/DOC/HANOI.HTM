<p><font size="3">The solution to the Towers of Hanoi puzzle is a
classic example of recursion. The ancient puzzle of the Towers Of
Hanoi consists of a number of wooden disks mounted on three
poles, which are in turn attached to a baseboard. The disks each
have different diameters and a hole in the middle large enough
for the poles to pass through. In the beginning, all the disks
are on the left pole as shown in:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The object of the puzzle is to move all the
disks over to the right pole, one at a time, so that they end up
in the original order on that pole. You can use the middle pole
as a temporary resting place for disks, but at no time is a
larger disk to be on top of a smaller one. It's easy to solve the
Towers of Hanoi with two or three disks, but the process becomes
more difficult with four or more disks.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A simple strategy for solving the puzzle is as
follows:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2">You can move a single disk directly.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">You can move <i>N</i> disks in three
        general steps:</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">Move <i>N</i>-1 disks to the middle pole.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">Move the last (<i>N</i>th) disk directly
        over to the right pole.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">Move the <i>N</i>-1 disks from the middle
        pole to the right pole.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="3">The Visual Prolog program to solve the Towers
Of Hanoi puzzle uses three predicates:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2"><b><i>hanoi</i></b>, with one parameter
        that indicates the total number of disks you are working
        with.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2"><b><i>move</i></b>, which describes the
        moving of <i>N</i> disks from one pole to another--using
        the remaining pole as a temporary resting place for
        disks.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2"><b><i>inform</i></b>, which displays what
        has happened to a particular disk.</font></li>
</ul>
