<P ALIGN=LEFT>Opens an existing file in a new edit window by using the standard <B>File Open</B> dialog box and reconsults its contents by asserting the facts and rules in the internal database. If the corresponding predicates already exists in the database, this action  will replace them.
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Note that any changes in the source text will take effect only after reconsulting it.
<P ALIGN=LEFT>This command is equal to <B><A HREF='consult.htm'>consult</A></B>(<I>FILENAME</I>) predicate.
<P ALIGN=LEFT>You can have many files open simultaneously. The <B>Consult</B> command does not close any editor windows that you have open. The PIE is restricted to editing a single version of any one file. So if you already are editing a file in a PIE Edit window then you cannot open another Edit window for the same file.
<P ALIGN=LEFT>PIE keeps track of the files you last worked on. You can quickly open one of them by selecting it from the list at the bottom of the File menu.
<P ALIGN=LEFT>You can create a new file by using the <A HREF='New.htm'>New</A> command or simply open an existing one (without reconsulting it) by using the <A HREF='Open.htm'>Open</A> command. Opened files can be then reconsulted any time using the <A HREF='Reconsult_.htm'>Reconsult</A> command.
<P ALIGN=LEFT>To quickly open an existing file, click the <B>Consult file</B> button on the toolbar or use hot key - <B>Ctrl+F8</B>
