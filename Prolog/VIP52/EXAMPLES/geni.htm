<h1>GENI - a Small Expert System</h1>

<p>There are many areas related to the topic of Artificial
Intelligence. Natural language processing (NLP), robotics and
object recognition are just a few. The AI domain also includes
Expert Systems, an area which is getting more and more attention.
In fact, Expert Systems and expert system shells are quickly
becoming the most researched topic of AI because many
corporations are finding that expert systems can help to make
quick and important business decisions.</p>

<p>GENI.PRO is a small classification-type expert system. GENI
shows how to construct a small expert system that figures out
which of seven animals (if any) the system's user has in mind.
The expert system will figure out the animal by asking questions
then making deductions from the replies given.</p>

<p>To run GENI, simply load GENI.VPR into Visual Prologs editor
and select RUN. After compiling, the program will display the
opening menu. The consultation with the knowledge base, GENI.DBA
will begin. </p>

<p>GENI will begin to prompt you with questions concerning the
domain given. Since GENI is a classification expert system, it
will try to identify an object. When you use the knowledge base
supplied (GENI.DBA), the domains are based on animals, so you
will need to have an animal in mind when you answer GENI's
prompts.</p>

<p>For example, suppose that you have chosen &quot;bird&quot; as
the domain. In other words, you are trying to classify a bird .
GENI begins the consultation by prompting with</p>

<p><em>Is it true that it has feathers:</em></p>

<p>Assume that you are trying to identify a penguin. Since all
birds have feathers, you use the answer menu to answer
&quot;Yes&quot; to this prompt. Simply press Enter to select Yes;
GENI will come back with the prompt</p>

<p><em>Is it true that it has long legs:</em></p>

<p>The bird does not have long legs. Answer the question.</p>

<p>From here, GENI will continue to prompt you, searching for a
solution to the animal you have in mind.</p>

<p><em>Is it true that it swims:</em></p>

<p>Since you are trying to solve for the penguin, you must answer
Yes to the prompt asking if the bird swims. This brings up the
prompt</p>

<p><em>Is it true that it has a black and white color:</em></p>

<p>Penguins are black and white, so again, you must answer
&quot;Yes.&quot; Here, GENI makes a conclusion and reports that
it thinks the bird is a penguin. GENI now asks whether its
conclusion is correct. Answer Yes to this query by typing in a
lowercase yes. </p>

<p>A typical user dialogue with this expert system might be:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>has it hair?
yes
does it eat meat?
yes
has it a fawn color?
yes
has it dark spots?
yes

Your animal may be a cheetah!</pre>
