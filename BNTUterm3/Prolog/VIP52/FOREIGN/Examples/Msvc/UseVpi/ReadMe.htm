<H1>Using VPI Visual Prolog DLL from C and C++ language</H1>
<P>Example uses MSVC 5.0 to bind with Visual Prolog DLLs. </P>
<P>(..\..\DLLS\EXE\DLL1.DLL)</P>
<P>(..\..\DLLS\EXE\DLL2.DLL)</P>
<P>DLL1 creates custom control in dialog with Denmark map.</P>
<P>DLL2 shows work with callback and retrieving string value.</P>
<P>Note: DLL1.DLL uses file DENMARK.DBA. You should run application from this directory by call "DEBUG\\CALL_DLL.EXE" or copy DENMARK.DBA to working directory.</P>
<P>See also <A HREF="../../Readme.htm">Using Visual Prolog DLL’s from other languages</A>.</P>
<H2>MICROSOFT FOUNDATION CLASS LIBRARY : call_dll</H2>
<P>AppWizard has created this call_dll application for you. This application not only demonstrates the basics of using the Microsoft Foundation classes but is also a starting point for writing your application. This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that make up your call_dll application.</P>
<P>call_dll.h</P>
<P>This is the main header file for the application. It includes other project specific headers (including Resource.h) and declares the CCall_dllApp application class. </P>
<P>call_dll.cpp</P>
<P>This is the main application source file that contains the application</P>
<P>class CCall_dllApp.</P>
<P>call_dll.rc</P>
<P>This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the program uses. It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored in the RES subdirectory. This file can be directly edited in Microsoft Developer Studio.</P>
<P>res\call_dll.ico</P>
<P>This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon. This icon is included by the main resource file call_dll.rc.</P>
<P>res\call_dll.rc2</P>
<P>This file contains resources that are not edited by Microsoft Developer Studio. You should place all resources not editable by the resource editor in this file.</P>
<P>call_dll.clw</P>
<P>This file contains information used by ClassWizard to edit existing classes or add new classes. ClassWizard also uses this file to store information needed to create and edit message maps and dialog data maps and to create prototype member functions.</P>
<P>/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</P>
<P>AppWizard creates one dialog class:</P>
<P>call_dllDlg.h, call_dllDlg.cpp - the dialog</P>
<P>These files contain your CCall_dllDlg class. This class defines the behavior of your application's main dialog. The dialog's template is in call_dll.rc, which can be edited in Microsoft Developer Studio.</P>
<P>/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</P>
<P>Other standard files:</P>
<P>StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp</P>
<P>These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file named call_dll.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.</P>
<P>Resource.h</P>
<P>This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs. Microsoft Developer Studio reads and updates this file.</P>
<P>/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</P>
<P>Other notes:</P>
<P>AppWizard uses "TODO:" to indicate parts of the source code you should add to or customize. If your application uses MFC in a shared DLL, and your application is in a language other than the operating system's current language, you will need to copy the corresponding localized resources MFC40XXX.DLL from the Microsoft Visual C++ CD-ROM onto the system or system32 directory, and rename it to be MFCLOC.DLL. ("XXX" stands for the language abbreviation. For example, MFC40DEU.DLL contains resources translated to German.) If you don't do this, some of the UI elements of your application will remain in the language of the operating system.</P>
