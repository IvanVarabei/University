<P ALIGN=LEFT>The main window has a standard Windows menu-bar at the top, and a status line at the bottom. In the middle you have the working area, where windows, dialog boxes and so on will be presented.  
<P ALIGN=LEFT>ESTA is a standard Windows MDI application, meaning among other things that several windows can be open at the same time. Each time you choose a menu command, a new window appears. Some of these windows will subsequently disappear when you click on the OK button or press Enter. Others remain until you close them explicitly using their system menus. Most menu commands affect only the currently active window. You can make a window active by clicking on it or by choosing it from the window list in the Window menu. Some of the windows function as editor windows, where you can type and edit text. For instance, when you create a new section, an editor window appears in which you can enter or edit the text defining the section. Other windows are for information purposes only, meaning that you can watch or scroll through the presented text and graphics, but not edit them. The dialog window is an example of such a window.  
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The various windows can be arranged within the working area either by cascading or by tiling. You can also iconize a window by clicking on its &quot;minimize&quot; button in the upper right corner, and all such icons can be automatically arranged by selecting Icons under the Window menu option. Tiling the windows makes it easier to compare, to move or to copy text from  one window to another. Cascading gives a nicer overview of a collection of windows and makes it easier to switch between them. To avoid too many opened windows at the same time, remember to close or iconize windows you no longer need. 
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The status line is divided into two areas. The status area to the left provides information about the currently selected menu command. The status area to the right displays information about the currently active window. During a consultation session, this same status area lists the current section and current parameter.
