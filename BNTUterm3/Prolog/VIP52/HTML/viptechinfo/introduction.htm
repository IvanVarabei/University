<p>Prolog is the result of many years of research work. The first, official version of
Prolog was developed at the University of Marseilles, France by Alain Colmerauer in the
early 1970s as a tool for PROgramming in LOGic. The result was a language far more
powerful than even today's well known programming languages, like Pascal and C. A Prolog
program for a given application will typically require only one tenth as many program
lines as the corresponding C++ program.</p>

<p>Today, Prolog is a very important tool in programming artificial intelligence
applications and in the development of expert systems. The demand for more &quot;user
friendly&quot; and intelligent programs is another reason for Prolog's growing popularity.
But the most important benefits of Prolog apply equally well to any application domain: By
allowing the programmer to model the logical relationships among objects and processes,
complex problems are inherently easier to solve, and the resulting program is easier to
maintain through its lifecycle. With Visual Prolog, applications such as customized
knowledge bases, expert systems, natural language interfaces, and smart information
management systems are now within your programming domain.</p>

<p>Prolog in general has moved out of the artificial intelligence labs, and PDC's Visual
Prolog is a commercially competitive, general-purpose development environment. Visual
Prolog has increasingly become the tool of choice for many developers, because of the
intelligent features that can be so easily added to programs or even web sites.</p>

<p>Prolog is what is known as a <i>declarative</i> language. This means that given the
necessary facts and rules, Prolog will use deductive reasoning to solve your programming
problems. This is in contrast to traditional computer languages, such as C, BASIC and
Pascal, which are procedural languages. In a procedural language, the programmer must
provide step by step instructions that tell the computer exactly how to solve a given
problem. In other words, the programmer must know how to solve the problem before the
computer can do it. The Prolog programmer, on the other hand, only needs to supply a
description of the problem and the ground rules for solving it. From there, the Prolog
system is left to determine how to find a solution.</p>

<p>Because of this declarative (rather than procedural) approach, well-known sources of
errors such as loops that carry out one too many or one too few operations are eliminated
right from the start. Prolog encourages the programmer to start with a well-structured
description of the problem, so that, with practice, Prolog can also be used as both a
specification tool, and the implementation vehicle for the specified product.</p>

<p>Visual Prolog addresses the same target market as SQL Database Systems, C++ development
systems and other language tools like Visual Basic, Borland's Delphi, or IBM's Visual Age.
The trend in many organizations today is to solve everything with database technology, but
this approach often leads to bad results in both development time and in the performance
of the final system. An application developed in Prolog can have far superior performance
and user friendliness along with a shorter development time. PDC's Prolog is particularly
well suited for these kinds of traditional database tasks, because Visual Prolog has among
its programming capabilities a full, very easy-to-use database engine. Programs created by
Visual Prolog are very fast because of the highly optimizing compiler, almost as fast as
C++-based applications.</p>
