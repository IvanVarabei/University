On receipt:

(1) Read the licence agreement (licence.txt).

(2) Destroy all your copies of the software if you
don't agree to the licence agreement.

(3) If you do agree to it, start the HTML files
to start trying the applet and then try designing
new graphics and rewriting the text files to
make it suit your website. (NB: ensure the directory
structures are correctly extracted from the zip file,
or the examples won't work).

(4) Note that this trial version is (a) fully-featured
and (b) nagware. It can do everything the release 
version does, but will display a nag screen every now
and again to remind you that it is unregistered.

(5) All documentation and purchase information is on
our website at http://www.imint.com. Our website also
has a very large support area with lots of useful
information.
