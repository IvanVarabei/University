<h1 align="left"><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>AI news for the OS/2 developers</b></font><!--mstheme--></font></h1>

<p>Visual Prolog is one of the world's most powerful implementations of the
Prolog-language, which combined with a powerful GUI-builder, an efficient compiler and a
large collection of tools, offers a very nice environment for developing AI applications
as well as traditional applications. <font color="#000000">Visual Prolog is the only
alternative, if you want to develop in Prolog in native OS/2! Prolog is the logic-based
programming language, that offers a wide range of possibilities: very readable and short
code, easy prototyping and facilities for simulation and meta-programming</font><font color="#0000ff">.</font> Visual Prolog has the logic facilities that make Prolog an
excellent problem solver, and the GUI-builder can turn these raw algorithms into
professional applications. </p>

<p>On top of all this, you can easily port the applications! Visual Prolog is one of the
most portable development tools available today. Windows 95 / NT / 3.1 and OS/2 are all
supported, and you can switch freely between these platforms for GUI-based programs. You
can also make portable textmode applications for DOS, SCO UNIX and Linux. Conversion
utilities help in converting resources between the different platforms. Very few
programming tools offer such a high degree of portability as Visual Prolog.</p>

<p>Visual Prolog is a highly professional tool, which scales up to large multi programmer
development projects. You can use Prolog&#146;s strengths in the Visual Prolog environment
to do database programming, web support, object-oriented programming, and much more: ODBC,
Oracle, DB2, TCP/IP, FTP, HTTP, ISAPI, generation and use of DLLs and standard .OBJ files,
an included Expert-system shell and Interpreter, domain checker and flow-analyzer,
determinism checking and fail-detection, large on-line help and support for generation of
help-files, resource import from other applications, graphical editors for cursors,
bitmaps, dialogs, toolbars, CodeExperts that assist in many areas of GUI building, etc. </p>

<p>The Internet is one of the hottest programming areas and Visual Prolog&#146;s strong
Internet support makes it an ideal tool for creating intelligent WEB sites! Intelligent
websites -expert systems attached to homepages, that can do automatic support and help
customers choose products will play an increasing role. <font color="#000000">Visual
Prolog can of course communicate with Java-applets, as illustrated in the examples</font></p>

<p>One of PDC customers sent us the following comment,<font face="Arial" size="2"> after
porting an application to the new Visual Prolog 4.1</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>&quot;Visual Prolog is a very fine tool!!! I have always
relied mainly on the command-line compilers because they have been so solid. Now, however,
I look forward to using Visual Prolog for many more projects. It is my impression that
version 4.1 will be THE big release of Visual Prolog.</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>The GUI portability is almost magic! I have done several
translation efforts and XVT compatibility projects in the past. This project has been the
most painless, and (in the end) the most compatible across platforms of any in my
experience.&quot;</i></font></p>

<p>Claus Witfelt, Product manager, PDC: </p>

<p>&quot;<i>We are very proud of our OS/2 version of Visual Prolog. The first versions we
have sent out have already been used for building mission critical applications, and the
developers have been very pleased with the compiler&#146;s performance, the tools and the
facilities.</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Prolog was originally designed to be an AI language, and it is very well suited for
expert systems and similar AI applications. Frame or rule-based systems, forward or
backward chaining, pattern-matching systems, and constraint-resolution systems; all are
natural and elegant expressions of Prolog&#146;s underlying semantics. Visual Prolog has
been used for advisory systems, decision support, diagnostics, expert system shells or
natural language applications, within a wide range of areas like banking, airline,
healthcare, insurance, medical, etc.</p>

<p>Yet the strengths of Prolog extend far beyond the boundaries of AI. The high level of
abstraction, the ease and simplicity with which complex data structures are represented
allow a declarative approach to programming that benefits any discipline or problem
solving strategy. Thus, Visual Prolog is also widely used to make administrative
applications, advanced database management, planning and scheduling systems and much more.</p>
