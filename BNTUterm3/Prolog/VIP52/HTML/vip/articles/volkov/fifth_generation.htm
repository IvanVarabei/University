<p>Prolog [1] was invented by A. Colmerauer in the university of Marseille in
1971 as high level programming language specialized for
automating reasoning and text processing. Later advantages
of Prolog became the basis to choose it as main language in the
famous japanese project of creation fifth generation
computers [2]. Visual Prolog is commercial version of this language. It combines scientific basis with practical tools such
as flexible external database system,
graphical user interface, effective compiler, debugger and a set of
ready tools that may be included into application. So it
is interesting to try it in some commercial domain where intellectual text processing is required. Now i can report
success of this experiment.</p>
<p>One of such domains is information business. Moscow commercial
information
agency Biznes-Karta (Business Map, www.biznes-karta.ru ) has the database
containing information about human
activities in various social spheres: industry, trade, transport, agriculture,
government, science, medicine, etc. More than 180000
organizations in Russia and republics of former USSR for which the address, phone, name of chief manager, number of
personnel, value of main funds and other
important parameters are available. This information helps people
to find each other in the conditions of market economy.
They sell it in three forms: as a pure data in DBF format,
in the form of electronic database and business reference
books.</p>
<p>I came to this firm in the autumn of 1996 and have got a task to modify
programs for preparation of these books. In
that time they had several utilities written in C language
under DOS and for each group of books one separate program
was used. I decided to rewrite this from scratch using
my PDC Prolog 3.3 and to create one program for preparation of all books.
So complicated report generator Publish appeared. It
transforms database into the text file that compose
main part of the book using such operations as data coding, sorting,
filtration, text transformation and formatting. Also
Publish generates supplementary parts of the book -
indexes and table of contents. Later i ported this program
under Windows in Visual Prolog 5.1 and now (according
to advertisement) Agency of Business Information issues annually
205 different books with total number of 800000.</p>
<p>But then they encountered difficulties with organizing of such large
scale
production and asked me to write some kind of automatic
management tool. Recently i have finished it. Automatic control system works on two-stage principle: analysis and
synthesis. The source data for this program
are monthly selling for each book and the amount at the warehouse.
For manipulations with these data the Tableedit tool was
chosen. There are three different tables: selling, parameters
that are different for each book and parameters, equal for each
book. User can input data manually or import from
book-keeping program. Off course user can edit data in the
table. On the stage of analysis the program calculates
average selling rate and predicts the date when the
stock will be empty. Also more complicated methods of regression analysis
may be used for the forecast. New calculated data are
displayed in the same table along with the source data.</p>
<p>The graphical representation is available. On the stage
of synthesis automatic control system must calculate the number
of books that is necessary to print and the date for
printing-office. There are several methods how to do it.
The program allows for maximal number of books that can be
printed per month and the importance of
different volumes. The hard copy of calculated data is available in different
formats for different departments of the company.</p>
