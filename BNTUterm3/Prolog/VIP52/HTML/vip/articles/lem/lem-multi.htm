<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this paper we describe implementation of general-purpose
ecological-simulator called LEM (Logic for Eco- Modeling). LEM is a forward chaining
rule-based system that supports interactive development of individual-based ecological
models. The behavior of agents and reaction of environment on the actions of agents is
specified by the sets of production rules. We have developed a number of ecological
simulation sample models such as migration of avi-fauna within limited space; emergence of
communication and cooperative behavior under various conditions and evolution of complex
food webs in an ecosystem. No knowledge of computer languages is required for developing
new models under LEM. It seems to us that LEM is the first general-purpose,
individual-based modeling tool that could completely relieve ecologists and Alife
researchers from programming work. Prolog has not been used earlier for developing
simulators and the main objective of this paper is to show how Visual Prolog could be used
for building simulators.</p>

<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000"><small>1. Multiagent Simulation &#150; New Approach to the Study of Complex Adaptive
Systems</small></b><!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#145;Complex adaptive system&#146; (CAS) is the term used to refer to
a system with the following properties (Hraber et al.[13]): a collection of primitive
components, called &quot;agents&quot;; nonlinear interactions among agents and between
agents and their environment; unanticipated global behaviors that result from the
interactions. Agents adapt their behavior to other agents and to the environmental
constraints, thus behaviors of component evolve over time. Eco-systems and economies are
often considered as an instances of this category of complex adaptive systems (Forrest and
Jones [11]; Holland [12]; Hraber et al.[13]).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult to write a system of differential equations that take
into account more than two or three factors that contribute to system dynamics. Useful and
predictive mathematical treatments are difficult, primarily due to the non-linearities,
discreteness, spatial inhomogeneities, and the changing behavior of the primitive elements
of the system (Hraber et al.[13]). Such a complex system could be studied by creating an
artificial universe of robotic animals via computer simulation and conducting experiments
in so created universe. This approach termed as &#145;multiagent simulation&#146; or as
&#145;individual based modeling&#146; has emerged during the last decade (Hraber et
al.[13]; Drogoul and Farber [2]).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Development of a multiagent simulator that reproduces natural behavior
in simulated environment is significant for enhancement of robots that operate in real
environment. However, most often multiagent simulation is used as a tool for research in
ethology and ecology and economics. The Boids by Reynolds [8], Tierra by Ray [7], ECHO
(Holland, [12]), ant model &#150; MANTA, (Drogoul and Ferber, [2]), LEE (Menczer and
Belew, [6]), Food web simulator &#150; Gecko, (Schmitz et al., [9]) are examples of
multiagent simulators. Ecological concepts considered in these simulators are as follows: <i>Trophic
levels, Food chain and Food web, Community assembly processes, Niche, ,Biodiversity,
Patchiness, Seasonality.</i> </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We believe that the development of methods for Multiagent simulation of
societies may bring considerable contribution to the science of animal behavior and the
study of ecosystems. This belief inspired us for a research project related to the
development of a Visual Prolog based system for multiagent simulation of ecosystems. The
overall structure of LEM models, syntax of model specification language and the
functionality of LEM modules and a provisional manual for LEM users, are now available on
Internet at the URL (s)- </p>

<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000"></b><small>2. Logic Based General Systems Theory as a framework for modeling and
simulation of CAS</small><b><font SIZE="3"><!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000">2.1 Logic Based approach to General Systems Theory</font></b><i><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Logic based approach to General Systems Theory</i> has been introduced
earlier by Krivov [5] as a formal framework for modeling and simulation of Complex
Systems. This framework serves as the methodological basis for the implementation of LEM.
&nbsp; Krivov also showed that the new approach to system modeling is especially
appropriate for research on Artificial Life and Complex Adaptive Systems. Its utility is
illustrated by the fact that it provides natural expressions for such concepts as <i>pattern
of organization, emergence </i>and<i> evolution, chaos, order.</i> </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The starting point of <i>Logic based approach to General Systems Theory</i>
is the observation that the classical definition of a system (Klir, [14]) is virtually
identical to the definition of<i> Model </i>in predicate calculus. Models are used for the
representation of algebraic structures such as groups, rings, fields&#146; etc. (Suppes,
[17]; Lightstone, [15]). However, these may also be used as semantic structures
representing the meaning of natural language expressions. <i>Model</i> and<i> System </i>both
are defined as a pair <i>&lt;Objects, Relations&gt;</i> where <i>Objects</i> is a set of
objects described and <i>Relations</i> is a set of relations i.e. predicates of different
arity which pertain to the objects. The similarity between the definitions of a system and
of a model brings forth the possibility of designing a logic based axiomatic theory of
systems. The formal framework designed is the result of refinement of Krivov's earlier
papers, where he considered the prospective for the use of models for description of
imaginative activity (Krivov, [3]) and reasoning about common sense situations (Krivov,
[4]). </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main idea of the present proposal for Logic Based General Systems
Theory is the use of &#145;models&#146; for the description of system states and
histories. Model is redefined as a triple:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;<i>Objects,Relations,
ModalOperators&gt;[time1,time2,time3&#133;time_n];</p>
</i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where the set <i>ModalOerators </i>describes interactions between <i>Objects</i>
that take place during the given time-sequence and set <i>Relations </i>describes the
relations between the <i>Objects</i>. Isomorphism of models may be interpreted as
isomorphism of systems. When one model has different isomorphic images in some other
model, it is a <i>repetitive pattern</i> for that model. A model has <i>symmetry</i> when
it has an isomorphic mapping into itself. The existence of a repetitive pattern usually
implies existence of some symmetry.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The dynamics of a system is described by the set of dynamic patterns:</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cond(t1),Cond(t2),&#133;,Cond(tn)-&gt;OPS(tn+1)</i> (If condition of
the RHS could match the model then the model should be extended by the set of modal
operators OPS(tn+1) that describe the state of the system at the time tn). </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Logic based General Systems Theory facilitates formal definition of
the 'pattern of organization' that is more general and even more natural in comparison
with such definitions phrased in terms of cellular automata or formal grammar theories. In
consequence, the proposed theory gives a novel view of 'organization', 'structure',
'behavior', 'chaos', &#145;order&#146;, and 'emergence'. Logic Based General Systems
Theory is intended to be a framework for simulation and analysis of Complex Adaptive
Systems i.e. ecosystems, social systems, economies etc. </p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000"></font><font size="4">2.2 An abstract model of a Complex Adaptive system</font></b><font size="3"><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font>Krivov [5] introduced the abstract computational
model of the ecosystem. This model is based on the theoretical framework designed. The
core algorithm of LEM is a practical implementation of this abstract model. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the model agents are considered as collections of states and rules
that define the agents' actions and states, depending on the state of the environment.
Environment is a collection of cells that store agents and modal operators describing both
the agents' actions and the reactions of the environment to their actions. There are two
kinds of rule tables. Action_Table is a set of rules for computing actions. It is
associated with agents. The_Law is a set of rules for computing the reactions of the
environment to the actions of the agents. In the model the environment is reduced to the
set of production rules that defines the outcome for all possible patterns of interactions
that may take place in the ecosystem. . In fact, all the properties of the environment are
completely defined by this rule table; it defines &quot;The Laws of Nature&quot; for the
given system. The rules of this table could define patterns of social interactions,
patterns of chemical reaction, or even a discreet approximation for the dynamic equations
of a particle moving in the field of force. This model facilitates the study of adaptation
and natural selection. The definition of the environment via rule tables reduces the
problem of classification of the environment to classification of the logical properties
of the production rules that constitute the environment. </p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ecosystem </i>is defined as a couple <i>&lt;{Site}<sub>I</sub>,The_Law
&gt;,</i> where<sub> </sub><i>{Site}<sub>I</sub></i> is a square grid of <i>sites </i>and<i>
The_Law </i>is a set of rules that define the law of interaction in the ecosystem.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each <i>site</i> is a container that can keep a number of agents,
relations, and operators. Thus at any particular moment of time a site may be represented
as a model: </p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&lt;Agents, Predicates, Operators &gt;.</p>
</i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as LEM is concerned regarding the implementation of the Abstract
model of CAS , there exist one to one correspondences between the description of LEM core
algorithm and the description of abstract model. Last two sections of this paper are
devoted to the detailed description of LEM architecture. A detailed description of
abstract model may be found in the Ph.D. thesis of Krivov [5]. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font>Agents are main entities of a LEM model. There
are 3 main categories of agents: Envo-agents, Producers and Etho-Agents. Besides these
three, there is also a special class of agents called landmarks that serve for identifying
places. Landmarks are visible only to the modeler and they do not play any role in
interaction of agents within an ecosystem.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each category of agents could be further subdivided into species. The
agents that belong to the same specie have similar appearance on the screen. They have the
same shape and color. They may also share some other parameters.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Envo-Agents represents non-living environmental factors such as
buildings, rocks, lakes etc. They may be used for the representation of the types of
landscape. They may also be used for representing those living elements of environment
that are used by all other agents merely as elements of environment. Envo-agents have no
state variables.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Producers represent the producers of the ecosystem. They have one
integer state variable that represents their biomass. Producers have also fixed growth
rate that is common for producers of the same specie.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Etho-agents represent primary, secondary and tertiary consumers. Only
etho-agents are capable of generating actions. Each etho-agent has a schemata- a set of
rules that define the behavior of the agent. The action of an etho-agent is calculated by
applying the rules from its schemata to the current environmental conditions and the
current states of the agent. Etho-agents could have any number of states. Each state has
double representation- as integer and as symbol. The state map is the set of pairs <i>&lt;symbol,
integer range&gt;</i> that defines the quality of the current integer state. Agents are
sensitive only to the qualitative aspect of their states. Etho-agents are unisexual i.e.
either male or female. They could interact with each other and they could interact with
producers and envo-agents.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font>The eco-systems of LEM are grids of sites. Each
site is a right square that could accommodate any number of agents of all the three
categories. Landmarks are not kept on the sites, they are stored separately from other
agents. In LEM, ecosystem agents could interact only with those agents that are located at
the same site at the moment of interaction. From topological point of view the ecosystem
is either 2 dimensional surface or tore. If an ecosystem is a 2-dimensional surface then
all agents that reach the border of the ecosystem change their direction of motion by 180
degrees. If an ecosystem is a tore then all agents that reach the border of the ecosystem
should vanish at the border and arrive from the opposite site of the ecosystem. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most important part of LEM ecosystem is the rule table that
specifies the patterns of interaction among agents and their outcome. This rule-table
called <i>The_Law</i> assigns one reaction to each action of etho-agent. The producers
that in fact are distributed on the site could receive many reactions during one
time-step. The overall effect or the actual reaction on producer is obtained by summing up
the reactions that producer had received.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Etho-agents are free to select any action which they
&quot;consider&quot; to be appropriate under given environmental conditions. The law table
defines the success or failure for the actions of the agents. Thus, it actually defines
the environmental pressure that an agent has to bear. The law table is especially
important for developing ALife evolutionary models. It gives an opportunity to study the
evolution of the same category of agents under different types of environmental pressure.<b><font SIZE="3"></p>

<h3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000"></font><font size="4"><a NAME="_Toc459114251"></a><a NAME="_Toc459115374">3.3 Types of models</a></font></b><font size="3"><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font>Currently LEM supports 4 types of models. The
type of a model is to be specified by the term:</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">model_type(MODELTYPE1,MODELTYPE2),</i> </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where <i>MODELTYPE1</i> is either <i>simple</i> or <i>evolution</i> and
<i>MODELTYPE2</i> is either <i>linear</i> or <i>cyclic.</i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a simple model, all etho-agents share one set of schema. The
schemata should be preprogrammed. This class of models is intended for individual based
simulations of ecological systems. When <i>MODELTYPE1 </i>takes the value <i>evolution </i>each
etho-agent has it&#146;s own private schemata. The schemata are rules that define the
agent&#146;s behavior. In evolutionary models, these rules serve as chromosomes. It means
that each newborn etho-agent inherits its schemata from parents after schemata of parents
undergo the processes of crossover and mutation. <i>MODELTYPE2</i> defines the
representation of time in the model. The linear time is just integer value that denotes
the current step of the simulation. In cyclic models there are options for representation
of seasons and periods of the day i.e. morning, night etc. The day and the year could be
divided into any number of periods. The modeler should specify the list of these periods
and their duration.<b><font SIZE="3"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font>Unlike Swarm [10] LEM has only one rigid schedule
of simulation. It would be appropriate to call it &quot;Trial-Resolution-Result&quot;
algorithm (TRR). While designing this algorithm, we pursued the objective to represent the
dichotomy between the `will' of an individual and the `will' of its surroundings in an
algorithmic form.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are 3 major steps in TRR algorithm: In the first step, all
etho-agents select actions that they consider as being the most relevant to their current
situation. The action of an agent could be either transitive i.e. directed to another
agent, or non-transitive. While selecting, the action and making an effort to perform this
action the agents enter into different forms of interactions with others. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the second step, the actual results of the interaction are defined.
As a matter of fact, viz. interactions of individuals in human, animal and even plant
societies are often accompanied by the contradictions of `wills'. In such a case, the
individuals participating in the interaction are `interested' in opposite outcomes from
the interactions. The rule table-<i>The Law-</i>serves for the purpose of resolution of
contradictions between individual efforts of agents. This table assigns certain symbolic
or numeric value to the action of individual, which is called `reaction'. The `reactions'
may denote success or failure as a consequence of the given action. They may also denote
the income and the loss in the value of some parameter.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the third stage, the real spatial positions and the states of the
agents are modified according to the rate specific for the combination of given action and
reaction.</p>

<h2><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000"><small>5. How rule-based programming could enhance the simulation technology</small><!--mstheme--></font></h2>
</b><font size="1">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font>Although LEM is rule-based system, it<b> </b>has
surprisingly high performance. On Pentium 133 MHz, 32 Mb RAM LEM could handle a population
of 1000 &#150;10000 agents with a reasonable speed (0.2-1 steps per one second). LEM could
maintain huge populations of agents. The maximum population that appears in one of the
experiments is 18000 (Krivov [5]). However, this is not the ultimate limit.<font SIZE="3"></p>
</font>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LEM is applicable to the study of a variety of problems related to
complex adaptive systems. These include, among others: migration; emergence of collective
behavior; social interaction; sexual reproduction; evolution of environments; evolution of
learning; multiple species, ecologies and even prey-predator population dynamics. Some
important kinds of sample models (still in developing stage) implemented under LEM are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Daily migration of Peafowl in the Campus of Jawaharlal Nehru University (Dahiya et al.,
    [1]). This is the part of an ongoing project (undertaken in collaboration with the lab. of
    Prof. Jaweed Ashraf at School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi) to
    design an individual based ecological modeling methodology for the assessment of the
    distribution of the individual species. The ultimate objective of this work is to create a
    computer program for <i>environmental impact assessment</i>. </li>
  <li>Emergence of communication and cooperative behavior under various conditions. </li>
  <li>Emergence and evolution of a complex food web in an ecosystem</li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The interactive character of modeling makes LEM outstanding among other
general-purpose simulators. So far as LEM is based on rule based methodology it inherits
all the strengths of this methodology along with the shortcomings. Nevertheless, LEM
models are not as fast as compiled models. Our experience shows that the penalty for speed
required while using rule based programming paradigm is negligible in comparison to the
convenience and flexibility that LEM inherits from rule based systems. The specification
of ecological model on specific to this area language makes LEM modeling affordable for
ecologists (who do not have special training in programming). LEM supports interactive
development of individual based ecological models. User could define any number of species
of agents with different behaviors that belong to 3 basic types -environmental agents,
producers, and etho-agents. Thus LEM could model ecosystems with an arbitrary and as
complex food chain as desired. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We conclude with the hope that LEM will represent both a remarkable
theoretical framework and a useful simulation tool for Ecologists and the Alife research
community.<b><i></p>
