<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We present a multiagent model using LEM simulator that enables one to
explore the influence of individual behavior on the dynamics and structural complexity of
route selection and local migration of animals within a real ecosystem over real time. The
individuals act according to simple, biologically plausible rules. Here we present the
results of a series of simulation experiments on space utilization by peafowl that is also
used to calibrate the simulator against real-world systems and to demonstrate the
simulator's strength for ecological modeling. This work involved a qualitative analysis of
local routes selected by the peafowl within the limited space. We also explored the
consequences of allowing individuals to make active choices about space selection by
assigning weights and found that individuals had to adapt realistic behavioral ecological
strategies. Our results lead us to believe that a better understanding of space
utilization in real-world systems will require new approaches that use all aspects of
Ecology i.e. the animal behavioral ecology along with population and community ecology
along with mathematical treatment of these aspects. </p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#000000">1. Introduction </b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our research work, we are trying the use of multi-agent simulation
to study complex phenomena emerging in real ecological systems. The problem of analysis of
ecosystem is a multifold one. It requires considerable efforts in experimental study of
the ecosystem as well as theoretical work in the fields of ethology, mathematics, and
computer science. Earlier we elaborated the main ethological principles in the context of
computer modeling of adaptive behavior (Krivov et al. [5]). In this paper we present a
multiagent simulation model of local migration of avi-fauna (Indian peafowl selected out
of the survey of a number of birds) within the natural ecosystem of Jawharlal Nehru
University (JNU), New Delhi Campus. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The dynamics of local migration of avi-fauna could be studied by
creating an artificial universe of robotic birds and animals via computer simulation and
conducting experiments in the so created universe. This approach is termed as
&#145;multiagent system simulation&#146; or as &#145;individual based modeling&#146; and
has emerged only during the last decade (see: Hraber et. al. [12]; Drogoul and Ferber
[2]). A multiagent system typically consists of many dispersed agents acting in parallel
with no global controller responsible for the behavior of all agents. Rather, the actions
of each agent depend upon the states and actions of a limited number of other agents, and
competition and coordination among the agents is subject to structural constraints. This
complex determines the overall direction of the system. The behavior of the whole system
tends to arise more from the interactions among the agents than from any constraints
imposed into structure of the whole system as such. Moreover, the local interaction
networks connecting the agents are continuously recombined and revised. In particular,
niches that can be exploited by particular adaptations are continuously created, and their
exploitation in turn leads to new niche creations, so that a perpetual novelty exists in
the system. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ant model &#150; MANTA by Drogoul and Ferber [2], generic ecosystem
model ECHO by Hraber et al. [12] and Food web simulator &#150; GHEKO by Schmitz et al.
[11] are examples of multiagent simulators. Usually a multiagent simulator has a target to
reproduce some emergent patterns of behavior. For instance, MANTA was used for the study
of labor separation in ant societies. ECHO was used for the study of abundance and
distribution of species emerging in the process of Darwinian evolution. We are using our
simulator LEM ( Logic for Ecological Modeling) (Krivov, [6]), to study route selection
dynamics among Indian peafowl .</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Route selection dynamics in an ecosystem is inherent in the
multi-factorial nature of interaction of animals among themselves as well as with their
environment. Many animal behavior patterns pertaining to their spatial movement occur on a
periodic daily basis that are regular and are regulated by internal biological clocks of
animals. It would be interesting to find out how the adult animals as well as their
offspring react to the environmental factors and how the route selection process emerges.
Very few efforts have been made to develop such simulation models. Route selection
dynamics is one of the complex problems that zoologists, ethologists and animal ecologists
are encountering in their field studies. &quot;Route selection&quot; is a complex
phenomenon in nature that arises when the resources are limited or widely distributed
within a spatially heterogeneous environment. </p>

Prolog</b><font SIZE="3"><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.1 LEM characteristics</p>
</b></font>

<p>The overall structure of LEM models, syntax of model specification, language, and the
functionality of LEM modules are now available on Internet at the URL: <b>http://geocities.com/SiliconValley/Cable/3109/
</b>OR <b>http://www1.50megs.com/lem/</b></p>

<p>OR <b>http://www.50megs.com/www1/lem/</b> site includes a provisional manual for LEM
users:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LEM is a forward chaining rule-based system implemented in Visual
Prolog (Krivov et al. [7]). The behavior of agents and reaction of environment on the
actions of agent are specified by the sets of production rules. LEM models could be simple
or evolutionary, time may be linear or cyclic. In evolutionary models, each agent has its
own rule base that also serves as a set of chromosomes. In simple ecological models, the
specie of agents shares the rule base and it should be preprogrammed. There is a special
rule table that defines the reactions of the environment to the actions of agents. LEM
supports interactive development of individual based ecological models. There is a special
language for specification of models. No knowledge of computer languages is required for
development of new models, and it seems that LEM is the first general-purpose
individual-based modeling tool that could completely relieve ecologists and artificial
life researchers from programming work. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LEM runs under Windows 95/98/NT. It could be ported to OS/2. It has
professional quality visual interface that is comparable with the best examples of Windows
programming. LEM is designed and implemented with the use of Object Oriented Paradigm. It
has high performance. On Pentium 133 MHz, 32 Mb RAM LEM could handle population of 1000
&#150;10000 agents with a reasonable speed (5-0.2 steps per one second). LEM comes with
the set of tools that facilitate development of individual based models: <i>Text editor</i>
with a set of standard Windows functions; fast <i>Data Base system</i> that could store
the relevant elements of simulation either in RAM or on disk; <i>Data Base query system</i>;
<i>Plotter</i> and <i>Pattern tracer</i>- a special tool for the monitoring of the
evolution of system organization and emergence of novel organization. Pattern tracer
directly uses the concepts of system organization. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following are the characteristics of LEM: </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ecosystem: </b>LEM ecosystem is a 2 dimensional grid of sites. It might
be similar to ecosystem design in Echo, Gecko, and Manta. However, sites in LEM ecosystem
have normal 2 dimensional topology. Each agent of LEM has double representation of its
location. Agents know the site, where it is located; in addition, it knows its&#146;
absolute position in the frame of reference of the ecosystem. The sites of ecosystem store
information about agents, which are currently located there, plus information about
actions of agents. <i>Monitor</i> is the part of LEM that displays the positions of agents
on the screen. <i>The_Law</i> rule table of LEM plays the role of Fight Monitor<b> </b>of
Gecko<b>.</b> <b>Agents: </b>Modeler could specify the behavior of LEM agents, number of
their states and some other parameters in run time. LEM is object oriented forward
chaining rule based system and thus has greater flexibility than simulators designed with
traditional object oriented methodology. <b>Evolution: </b>The current implementation of
LEM support study of behavioral evolution that can happen within in a relatively short
time. <b>Simulation: </b>LEM was designed as a general-purpose tool for ecological
modeling. Finally, it should be used for simulation of real ecosystems. All other
simulators except some like SWARM does not pursue this objective. <b>Database: </b>Almost
all multiagent simulators have some tools for monitoring the simulation. However, LEM
database has unmatchable capacity for performing this task. <b>Pattern Tracer: </b>Pattern
tracer is unique LEM tool for tracing possible patterns of interaction within ecosystem.</p>

Adaptation supported by LEM</a></b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current version of LEM supports 2 models of adaptation &#150;
Genetic Adaptation and Route Adaptation</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Genetic adaptation </b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Evolutionary models of LEM mimic natural evolution. Genetic adaptation
is the most common to ALife simulators' way of adaptation. In evolutionary models any
etho-agent possesses its private set of schema that are treated as chromosomes during the
process of reproduction. Thus in this model of evolution only the schemata of agents are
evolving. The evolution of schemata mimics evolution of agent&#146;s behavior.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Signature based evolutionary models allow to study evolution of the
physical properties of agents. Although this option is implemented in the current version
of LEM, it will not be discussed in the present paper.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Route adaptation</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cyclic models of LEM which were designed during our study of
Peafowl&#146;s daily migration mimic spatial and temporal adaptation of animals to the
changing environment This is the kind of adaptation that is taking place during the life
of individual. The gist of route adaptation is as follows:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.1 General Field Survey</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jawaharlal Nehru University Campus lies on the off-shoots of northern
part of the Aravali hills locally known as Delhi Ridge in southern Delhi (28 deg 12&#146;
&#150; 28 deg 53&#146; north latitudes and 76 deg 50&#146; &#150; 77 deg 23&#146; east
longitudes; average altitude of Delhi is 213-219 meters above sea level. The campus is
spread over an area of 412.54 hectares on South Central Ridge. This land belongs to the
category of `<b>tropical thorn forest</b>&#146;. More than 50% of this land is covered
with vegetation and has no major permanent water bodies; hence is dependent on monsoons
for its water supply. The quartzite rocks form the base of the JNU campus. The soil cover
on the lower areas is formed of weathered material. Tropical thorn forest is spread over
this soil cover under semi-arid climatic conditions. Large parts of this land is now
occupied by man made-structures .The mainland or macrohabitat is made of <b>Dense
vegetation area, </b>seen in the lower parts of the Campus which consists of thick base of
soil cover holding fast growing and drought resistant perennial species; <b>Woodland like
area </b>i.e. the areas covered by widely spaced trees, or other vegetation and <b>Scrubland</b>
that<b> covers </b>more than fifty percent of the total Campus area. It includes perennial
drought resistant varieties of shrubs and bushes. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A survey was conducted on the Avi-fauna of the campus, and a checklist
of birds was prepared (Dahiya and Krivov, [1]). From this list, Indian peafowl was
selected as the animal model of the study. Knowledge about ecology and behavior of any
peacock pheasant in the wild is very limited. This makes it difficult to establish a
satisfactory regular pattern of field routine. The most fundamental field method used was
the SURVEY WALKS. The area was walked along fixed paths and locations of peafowl were
plotted on the gridded map of the study area, at set times for several consecutive days
and the observations were made accordingly. </p>
</a><b><font SIZE="3">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.2 Indian Peafowl<i>, Pavo cristatus </i>was selected mainly for the
following reasons:</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. This specie could be easily recognized, especially the male, by its
large size, iridescent colors, erect crest with unique display and its distinct loud call
which could be easily heard and recognized over long distances.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. Peafowl is gregarious in nature and flocks could be recognized which
usually return to their resting sites every night.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. The bird maintains its territory within limited space though home
range may vary according to seasons.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. Migration is generally limited to daily-migration for foraging if
its habitat is not affected. Moreover it is sedentary and terrestrially adapted bird.<font SIZE="3"></p>

  <ol START="3">
    <b>
    <li>Habitat selection made by peafowl
</b>

    </font></li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The observations supported with other relevant studies (cited as per
the context) show following criteria in habitat selection made by the peafowl that
influence its local migration:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. Availability of water is their main requirement (Johnsingh and
Murali [3]). For the present study, location of water bodies, and their relationship with
the feeding or resting space is yet under observation. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. Tall trees to roost on favorably near feeding space, dense bushes
with open areas for breeding, and availability of adequate nest sites and feeding grounds
(Johnsgard, [13]). </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.As peafowl is omnivorous and usually a primary consumer, the criteria
of habitat selection based on availability of food is equally important. Its preference of
feeding spaces is in the order of : containing grains&gt; human oriented food&gt; natural
food. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Peafowl maintains its home-range and is a lek-breeding species (Rands
et al., [9]; Ridley et al. [10]) and shows philopatry to their display site (tends to
roost and rest near to display sites which are few meters apart over the whole breeding
season) (Rands et al. [9]; Petrie et al. [8]). Such leks are situated apart from each
other in woodland and more clumped in open land (Hillgarth [4]). Peafowl is normally
attached to its traditional roosting site and usually returns to it on sunset. This site
is near its feeding space and also the water source. It selects tall trees for roosting,
especially the tree which contains the first branch considerably at a higher distance from
the ground which helps escape from predators. In the present study, the primary roosting
site was found around the three traditional feeding grounds. This area also contains
higher density of peafowl population. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The field observations made in JNU campus on the habitat use by peafowl
revealed some set patterns of its daily migration. The space is divided into 18 resting
spaces and 21 feeding spaces (see screenshots a and b) in accordance with the movement of
associations of peafowl. Each association could be of many flocks and some flock may
behave differently in their movement and may explore entirely new feeding or resting space
in the real ecosystem. This aspect we are keeping for our more complex models in order to
make the present model simple. Likewise, 18 major associations were observed which
generally move to feeding spaces at sunrise and return to its resting spaces at sunset.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Peafowl&#146;s daily migration is regulated by photoperiod. In the
present field study it was observed that peafowl prefers seeds and other such food
provided by the local residents in the feeding spaces nos. 1, 3 &amp; 4 (see screenshots-
fig. 1 a&amp;b) which cites they visited regularly almost at the same time at sunrise and
at sunset and would wait in the surroundings nearby if the human feeders were late. Some
observations made on individual birds/flock suggest that peafowl has a very sharp
biological clock. One hen and sometimes the whole flock was observed crossing the road
between resting space number 12 to the feeding space number 14 exactly around 5.30 pm in
the evening, which observation coincides with the clearing of Hostel mess (Godavari
Hostel) and preparations for dinner. One peacock was observed moving from resting space
no. 18 to feeding space no. 19 around 7.00 am in the morning and re-entering to the same
resting space during 7.30 pm in the evening. One flock was seen moving and foraging during
6.30 a.m. daily near the backside of School of International Studies, for few months
repeatedly.<b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this model, each association performs some action, which is time and
space specific. Four categories of actions have been taken into account, moving, eating,
resting, and mating. All these actions are goal-oriented. These actions in the real
ecosystem may in turn be bound by many related actions. For instance &quot;moving&quot;
means that some association is moving from one space to another for some goal (like feed,
forage or roost). LEM supports wide range of actions pertained to moving. </p>

time steps when reproduction is completed in just 6 steps and fig. 2 (b) shows the
population growth curve over a period of two years in approximately 5490 time steps with
reproduction steps set at 600 steps and the initial population as w = 89, m = 52, F = 23,
T = 26, &amp; = 6, c = 0. Seasonal dynamics may be noted here as &quot;&amp;&quot; is
preprogrammed to reproduce only during summers. The rise of population is periodic. The
offspring are able to inherit sometime whole route from the parents, or with reduced
number of periods and sometimes having no period at all. Accordingly, offspring&#146;s
route is defined. In Fig. 3 (a) shows a screenshot at the 0-time step and Fig. 3 (b) shows
after the birth of offspring in on completion of one whole year. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This model presents a good example of artificial migration and
artificial biological-rhythm and its dynamics that arise out of movement of
&quot;&amp;&quot; from one point to another which is based on real observations. Many
animal behavior patterns occur on a periodic daily basis that is regular. Biological
rhythms are manifestations that are regulated by internal biological clocks of animals.
These rhythms could be dependent upon the environmental factors or a self&#150;sustaining
and adjustable pacemaker mechanism could be set up in accordance with the feed back from
the environment. In nature, animals show different rhythms with periods ranging from few
minutes to several years. An important observation noted by us is the fact that often
offspring develop their own routes. However, with the rise of population the route
selection also lowers down. Since the model of real ecosystem is in progress valuable,
observations would come out after some more efforts that are in progress. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The route adaptation model should serve for study of spatial behavior.
It may be relevant for study of environmental impact assessments when effect of
environmental changes on spatial distribution of animals has to be evaluated.<i><font SIZE="3"></p>
