pure Prolog (no VPI).

NOTES:

1. Symbols Script and Build Script (as a reference info) for each 
   platform are placed to the root directories of the each example
   project. Sript files have general name 'script.txt'.

2. DLL library for the WIN32 platform must be added to the Symbol Scripts
   as it is shown in the example. For the Win16 platform it is possible
   to add the DLL library file to the Project Window.

3. To run examples it is needed to compile first the 'dll1' and 'dd2' projects 
   and then compile the projects in 'calldll' directory.
   The libraries and final exe files will be created in the .EXE directory.
