player along with their presentation or program.
This information sheet sets forth Autodesk's policy regarding the copying and 
distribution of some of its players and associated libraries (jointly referred to as 
the
"Players").

up on the splash screen for your animations. Proprietary notices 
which are embedded in the code should not be removed.
