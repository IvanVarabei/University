<p align="left"><b>readchar</b>(<i>Char</i>) </p>

<p align="left">Read a single character </p>

<p align="left"><b>Remarks</b> </p>

<p align="left"><b>readchar/1</b> reads a single character from
the current input device (which is the keyboard, unless changed
via <b>see/1</b>). When reading from the keyboard, a number of
keys, including the function and cursor keys, will return two
characters, where the first is ASCII 0. </p>

<p align="left">In Windows and OS/2 PM programs, <b>readchar/1</b>
will only work if the current input device is redirected to a
file. </p>

<p align="left">Notice the different behavior of readchar in OS/2
textmode programs when the current input device is the keyboard.
The first called <b>readchar/1</b> does not obtains the first
typed char immediately, it will wait until the Enter will be
pressed. Only then OS/2 makes input stream accessible to <b>readchar/1</b>.
From this moment all characters, typed before the Enter, become
immediately accessible to consequently called <b>readchar/1</b>
predicates (if they are). When all typed (before the Enter) chars
are taken away from the input stream, then <b>readchar/1</b> (if
one is called) will again waiting for the Enter before receiving
char from input stream. For example, the below fragment </p>

<pre>counter(0,99,I),        % (i,i,o); every time add 1 to I;
write(&quot;Line %&quot;, I),nl,
readchar(_),
fail.
</pre>

<pre>can have the following output: </pre>

<pre>Line 0     % is printed immediately
123&lt;Enter&gt; % user types 123 and then press &lt;Enter&gt;
Line 1     % Lines 1,2 and 3 will be printed
Line 2     % immedaiately after &lt;Enter&gt; is pressed
Line 3     %
% readchar again will waiting for &lt;Enter&gt;
... </pre>

<p align="left"><b>Example</b> </p>

<pre>write(&quot;\nEnter a character: &quot;),
readchar(CH1),
write(&quot;\nThe character was: &quot;,CH1),
CH1=0,
write(&quot;\nIt was a function key&quot;),
readchar(CH2),
writef(&quot;\nKey code1=%d:'%c', Key code2=%d:'%c'&quot;,CH1,CH1,CH2,CH2). </pre>
