on the WEB</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>In the &lt;<i>VIP_root</i>&gt;\ WWW\Programs\GENI sub-directory you will find an example,
that demonstrates, how to create a little expert system that works on the Internet
as a CGI Script through a WEB server.<br>
GENI is extremely simple knowledge representation also shown under
\TXTEXAMP and VPI\PROGRAMS, where there are some rules that are satisfied
if a list of conditions are true.</P>

<DIR>
<DIR>
<P>rule(1,&quot;carnivore&quot;,&quot;cheetah&quot;,[1,2],&quot;&quot;)<BR>
rule(2,&quot;carnivore&quot;,&quot;tiger&quot;,[1,3],&quot;&quot;)<BR>
rule(3,&quot;ungulate&quot;,&quot;giraffe&quot;,[5,2,4],&quot;&quot;)<BR>
cond(1,&quot;it has tawny color&quot;,&quot;&quot;)<BR>
cond(2,&quot;it has dark spots&quot;,&quot;&quot;)<BR>
cond(3,&quot;it has black stripes&quot;,&quot;&quot;)</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>GENI can primarily be used for classification. The goal of GENI is to
illustrate, how things are working, not to implement an advanced inference
engine. However the same principles can be used to build more complex shells
like the ESTA expert system included with Visual Prolog.</P>

<P>The example is supplied along with 3 knowledge bases (*.GNI files):
Animals , Starting and Tyreproblem. </P>

<P>In the non-web based version of GENIE, questions are asked and answers
given while the program is using recursion. This is not possible, when
working, with a GCI&nbsp;script, on the net, because a CGI program cannot
run constantly during the consultation. The big problem is how and where
to store the previous state of the consultation!</P>

<P>The solution used here is that the state stored as hidden fields in
the HTML form which are sent to the browser each time an answer is returned
from the application. So it is the user who carries the information from
page to page. When the CGI program GENI.EXE is restarted each time an answer
is received, it must reinitialize the answers from the hidden parameters.
The list of parameters is retrieved by the predicate call cgi_GetString,
and the call to assert_conditions assert yes/no facts for all previous
answered conditions.</P>

<P>The very first hidden parameter specifies the name of the knowledge
base as a .GNI file which must be consulted.</P>

<P>A summary of the operation of GENI on the WEB is: (Take a look at the
source code)</P>

<OL>
<LI>Retrieve the CGI parameter list cgi_GetString.</LI>

<LI>Convert the String to a list of parameter names together with values.</LI>

<LI>Consult the knowledge base specified in the first hidden parameter.</LI>

<LI>Assert the conditions from the hidden parameters.</LI>

<LI>Re-invoke the inference engine.</LI>
</OL>

<P>The result of running the inference engine is that it writes out an
HTML page which contains a FORM with the hidden parameters and the question
relating to the next condition.</P>

<P>When a solution is found GENI writes a final HTML page containing an
answer.</P>

<P>For each condition it is possible to specify either some HTML code or
a file in order to customize the question.</P>

<P>A specialty of expert systems is that it must be possible to ask WHY.
In this case GENI prints out the rules it is using and the conditions already
answered.</P>

<P>We send our special thanks to Mr. Leo Jensen, who is the head of Prolog
Development Center, and who was very helpful to us during this project.</P>
