Geni on the WEB !

WWWgeni - An Expert system developed using Visual Prolog 5.0 Professional and 
MS information server running under Windows NT.

See the Inetpub\geni\readme.htm file for information about WWWgeni.

To run the project you need to do two things:

1) Copy the GENI subdirectory to your WWW server root directory

2) If using the Peer Web services or MS IIS, set up a virtual directory
   called /GENI that points to the new \GENI subdirectory. You may need to
   do something similar if using an alternative WWW server. 

3) Make sure that your (anonymous) Internet users are granted read and execute access 

4) Then you should be able to open the main page:
http://Your_machine_name/geni/default.htm


Note that geni.exe is a 32-bit Textmode executable for Win95/WinNT. 
To create a 16-bit version some files will need to be renamed.
